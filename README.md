An R package to write to STL files with color. Currently in development.
## Overview
STLcraft is an R package designed to provide support for creating STL files (often used in computer design and 3d printing) in R. 
The package aims to provide support for printing STL files with color and including some holes. 

Currently needs some refactoring as the methods to actually export STL files are messy (although funtional).
## Instalation
The development version can be installed with:
``` R
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/STLcraft")
```
## Usage
To be added once the methods for exporting STL's are finalized.
